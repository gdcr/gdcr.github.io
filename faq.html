      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Is this event for learning how to program?</h3>

      <p>No, sorry. Coderetreats are great for programmers become better, but they are not good at teaching people how to program.</p>

      <p>That's not to say you have to be an expert, or even intermediate, programmer to attend. Regardless of your skill level, you will have things to lear and to teach. But if you have no programming experience then the Coderetreat will be more frustrating than fun.</p>

      <h3>Why can't I RSVP?</h3>

      <p>We are currently full. If you want to be put on a waiting list, email whit0694@umn.edu</p>

      <h3>What is the Happy Hour?</h3>

      <p>Location is TBD, but we'll head somewhere for food and drinks. As many of our attendees will be under 21, we will be going somewhere that works for all ages.</p>

      <p>Snacks and appetizers will be paid for, but any drinks (alcoholic or not) will be your responsibility.</p>

      <h3>How do I let you know if I decide I can no longer attend?</h3>

      <p>You can go back to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdf9Jk0ueBsgI8tBaxbjmk06y2yRN06WanbNaFhonTHq4M9pQ/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSVP page</a> and change your answer, or you can email me directly at whit0694@umn.edu</p>

      <h3>Can I use [insert programming language here]?</h3>

      <p>Probably! Throughout the day we'll be working on implementing Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and you should be able to to do that in any programming language.</p>

      <p>I do ask that if you bring your own laptop you have it set up to run whatever programming language you want to use. Our day will be very full and we won't have time to configure machines.</p>

      <h3>What should I bring?</h3>

      <p>Not much. If you have a laptop, bring it (and make sure it's got your language(s) of choice ready to go). Pens, pencils &amp; paper are always handy.</p>
